# BH_HR_DR
Open-loop lumped parameter network of a 5 month old infant with single ventricle physiology. Models the Berlin Heart EXCOR, as pediatric pulsatile ventricular assist device, connected the left ventricle under different heart rates, device rates, and phase shift combinations (nts = 250000, dt = 0.0001). Device rates simulated are 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120. Phase shifts of [-pi,pi] at intervals of pi/4 are simulated for each HR/DR combination. The Berlin is driven at 220/-20 with 40% systole. 

90_LV_Berlin_Norwood.py -- Heart rate set to 90 bpm. 
150_LV_Berlin_Norwood.py -- Heart rate set to 150 bpm.
